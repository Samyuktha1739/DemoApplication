RecursionError:-
a.The Python RecursionError is an exception that occurs when the maximum recursion
 depth is exceeded.
b.This typically occurs when a function calls itself recursively, and the recursion doesn't have a
 proper stopping condition (base case).
c.It is caused by a function calling itself recursively without a proper base case.
d.Python has a limit on the number of times a function can call itself recursively.
e.the recursive function func() does not have a terminating condition, calling it creates an 
infinite loop as the function keeps calling itself over and over again until the
 RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded error occurs:
Adding a base case
Increasing the recursion limit
Using an iterative approach
--------------------------------------------------
TYPE ERROR:-
a.need to be instantiated, or called, before you can access their methods.
b.If you forget to instantiate an object of a class and try to access a class method, 
you encounter an error saying “missing 1 required positional argument: ‘self’”.
c.Positional arguments refer to data that is passed into a function. 
d.In a class, every function must be given the value “self”.
e.The most common mistakes that are made that cause the “missing 1 required 
   positional argument: ‘self’” error are:

1.Forgetting to instantiate an object of a class
2.Using the incorrect syntax to instantiate a class
